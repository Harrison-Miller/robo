A simple multiplayer top down shooter made over spring break as networking practice.

This game was made mostly as a testing platform for implementing complex networking described in these articles
http://gafferongames.com/ as well as some on the source engine's networking.

If you wish to just play the game you can download it. https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6826017/win32_robo.zip
